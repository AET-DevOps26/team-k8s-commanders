# team-k8s-commanders

Repository for team K8s Commanders.

## Local development setup

This project keeps Git hooks and generator tooling in the repository so that a
single setup step is enough to get a working development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js and npm (LTS recommended)
- Java JDK (required by OpenAPI Generator)
- Optional: Python 3.10+ for running generated FastAPI models locally

### Quick setup

Run the consolidated setup script from the repository root. It will:

- install Node dev dependencies into `node_modules`,
- enable the repo-managed Git hooks, and
- attempt an initial code generation (FastAPI models, Spring server stub,
  TypeScript API types).

```bash
./scripts/setup-all.sh
```

### What the setup script does

- `scripts/setup-generators.sh` — installs Node dev dependencies from
  `package.json`.
- `scripts/install-hooks.sh` — sets `core.hooksPath` to `git/hooks` so the
  versioned shell hooks run automatically.
- `api/scripts/gen-all.sh` — runs OpenAPI Generator and the model generators
  (also invoked by the `post-checkout` and `post-merge` hooks).

## Useful commands

Re-run generator setup only (no hooks):

```bash
./scripts/setup-generators.sh
```

Install hooks only:

```bash
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Generate artifacts manually:

```bash
./api/scripts/gen-all.sh
```

Run the pre-commit OpenAPI lint hook manually:

```bash
./git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Where files are written

- Spring server stub: `services/springboot/generated/`
- FastAPI model objects: `services/ai-assistant/models/`
- TypeScript API types: `web-client/src/api.ts`

The `services/*/generated/` and `web-client/src/api.ts` paths are listed in
`.gitignore`. The FastAPI models under `services/ai-assistant/models/` are
checked in so the AI assistant service can import them directly.

## Troubleshooting

- If generation fails because a tool is missing, verify that `npm` and a Java
  JDK are installed and re-run `./scripts/setup-generators.sh`.
- OpenAPI Generator requires a Java JDK on `PATH`. Install one if a
  Java-related error is reported.

## Updating generator tools

- Node tools: edit `package.json` and run `npm install`.
- For a custom FastAPI implementation, create a separate Python environment
  and import the generated models from `services/ai-assistant/models/`.

## Notes

- Hooks are implemented as shell scripts under `git/hooks` and are
  authoritative; no `pre-commit` YAML is required.
- The OpenAPI specification lives at `api/openapi.yaml` and is the single
  source of truth for all generated clients and server stubs.
